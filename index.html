                                Kyiv (or Kiev), Ukraine's capital, is a large city located 
                                on the shores of the Dnipro river. Of course, no one in 
                                their right mind would swim in the river, unless they grew 
                                up here, in which case they've probably tried it at some 
                                point. Summers are hot here, and the winters are drafty, 
                                but the fall and the spring are are absolutely amazing.

                                The city itself is a mix of pre-revolution, post-war and 
                                soviet architecture, all of it sprinkled with modified 
                                balconies. If you're on the right bank of the Dnipro, the 
                                landscape is difficult to traverse for people on bikes 
                                and those wearing heels. The left bank is considered far 
                                less interesting and prestigious though, even by people 
                                who live on the far outskirts of the right one.

                                The medieval ruin of Cricieth Castle overlooks the town 
                                below from a rock that juts out into the sea. It is 
                                thought to have been built by Llewelyn the Great in the 
                                13th century. Some 900 years later, the self-styled Pearl 
                                of Wales on the Shores of Snowdonia has become a popular 
                                tourist destination during the summer months.

                                A short walk down the road from the castle, you can enjoy

                                ingredient is rumored to be locally sourced seaweed. 
                                Another claim to fame is the fact that Cricieth won the 
                                Wales in Bloom award for five years in a row for its 
                                spectacular floral displays around town. It was also home 
                                to David Lloyd George, the only Welshman ever to hold the 
                                office of Prime Minister of the UK.

                                Berea is a small town located in the central part of 
                                Kentucky. The town is surrounded by beautiful forests and 
                                countryside. It's known as the arts and crafts capital of 
                                the state, and visitors will find plenty of shopping 
                                opportunities: shops with handmade jewelry, candles, wood 
                                items, galleries, glass studios, and more. The town holds 
                                a yearly festival celebrating "spoonbread", a local dish 
                                made with cornbread and served with a wooden spoon.

                                However, it's probably known best for the local college. 
                                Berea College was founded in 1855 and was the first college 
                                in the south to be racially integrated, as well as the first 
                                to be coeducational. Somewhat uniquely, it charges no tuition 
                                â€” every student receives a full-tuition scholarship.

                                Muramvya is one of the 18 provinces of Burundi. In the kingdom

                                its cultural and natural landscape, it was added to the UNESCO

                                The weather is rather chilly at night, but during the day, you 
                                would think you're in heaven. At 2,665 meters (8,743 ft) above 
                                sea level, Mount Teza is one of the coldest places in the 
                                province. But that cool breeze allows for one of the largest 
                                plantations of tea and coffee in the country, which make up the 
                                bulk of Burundi's exports.

                                The Kibira National Park, one of the largest wildlife reserves 
                                for apes, overlaps four provinces, including Muramvya. This 
                                National Park lies at the apex of the beautiful mountains of the 
                                Congo-Nile Divide, ranging between 1550 and 2660 meters of altitude. 
                                It is filled with beautiful vegetation, and a source for the

                                Yekaterinburg lies at the crossroads between Europe and Asia, 
                                east of the slopes of the Ural Mountains in central Russia. 
                                The continental divide is 30 kilometers west of the city. 
                                Yekaterinburg is Russia's third or fourth largest city with a 
                                population of 1.5 million. It was founded in 1723 and is named 
                                for Peter the Great's wife, Catherine I.

                                Today, Yekaterinburg is primarily known both as a center of heavy 
                                industry and steel-making, the Russian equivalent of Pittsburgh, 
                                and as a major freight transportation hub. Its major industries 
                                include ferrous and non-ferrous metallurgy, chemicals, timber, and 
                                pulp and paper. The city also has a reputation as a center of higher 
                                education and research. The Urals Branch of the Russian Academy of 
                                Sciences is located there with its 18 institutes and numerous research
